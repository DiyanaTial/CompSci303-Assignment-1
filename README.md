# C++ Stack Operations Program

## Overview
This C++ program implements a stack data structure using a custom `Stack` class. It allows users to perform various operations on the stack, such as pushing elements onto the stack, popping elements from the stack, checking if the stack is empty, retrieving the top element of the stack, and calculating the average value of the stack elements.
